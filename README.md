Hi Humans!

Justin here, I like history and good storytelling in media (videogames, anime, tv shows, etc.)
I think that we need to evolve more as a species and adapt fast enough to the changes being brought by technology.
I am unconcerned about artificial intelligence. 
It is not because I don't think that the technology is dangerous but it because I feel a certain way.
I feel that if we can not keep up with technological change, we deserve to be eradicated and replaced by something better or superior. Cosmic horror played around with the idea that there are things out there in the unvierse beyond our understanding. We could be replaced by something greater and superior than us and the universe would not care. I feel something similar about robots replacing us. 
I am reminded of the concept of the Fermi paradox. There is this idea of the Great Filter; a test for intelligent life to pass or fail. The math says there should be other life in the universe. A reason for this might be that these other civilizations have reached a point where they are able to destroy themselves.  In some ways, we may be reaching that point with artificial intelligence. It could be argued that we have passed this Great Filter with nuclear weapons. Even so, I think this question continues to loom over human existence as we develop stronger, better, and deadlier technology. Can we keep up with our technology? Though the human actors can change, can human understanding and nature be changed so that such weapons or technology never have to be used to devestating effect?
